## Using Git for SQL Query Management in Dotmatics

This repository contains `.sql` files used within the Dotmatics platform for managing and querying data through "Datasources". The files are tracked using Git for version control to ensure reliable change tracking, collaboration, and historical record-keeping. Each SQL script serves specific functionalities, i.e. REGISTRY or CHEM_ELN. This structure facilitates efficient development, testing, and deployment of SQL code within the platform.

### **1. Version Control**: Track changes to SQL queries over time, allowing easy reversion to previous versions if errors occur.

### **2. Collaboration**: Enable team members to work simultaneously on queries, reducing conflicts and enhancing accountability through clear ownership.

### **3. Quality Assurance**: Implement a review process for changes to catch errors early and ensure high-quality queries through testing.
